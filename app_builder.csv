QUESTION NO: 1,"Cloud Kicks (CK) captures all shipping information in a custom object called Shipments__c.
CK's app builder is tasked with creating an approval process to ensure department members
can approve all overnight shipments.
Where should the app builder route the approval request?",A. Hierarchy field,B. Role,C. Public group,,,,C,"Public group is the best option to route the approval request for overnight shipments. Public
groups can include users, roles, or other groups. Queues are used to assign ownership of
records to a group of users, not for approval processes. Hierarchy field and role are not
flexible enough to include only the department members."
QUESTION NO: 2,"The app builder needs to change the data types of new custom fields. The app builder is not
able to delete and recreate any of the fields, nor modify any apex code. Which data type
change will require the app builder to perform the additional steps in order to retain existing
functionalities?",A. Changing the data type of a field used in an apex class from number to text.,B. Changing the data type of a field used in a report from a text to an encrypted field,C. Changing the data type of a field used as an external id from number to text.,,,,A,"Changing the data type of a field used in an apex class from number to text will require the
app builder to perform additional steps in order to retain existing functionalities. This is
because changing the data type of a field may affect the apex code that references or
manipulates the field value, and may cause compilation errors or unexpected results. The
app builder will need to update the apex code to handle the new data type and ensure that
the logic and calculations are still correct. Option B is incorrect because changing the data
type of a field used in a report from a text to an encrypted field will not require additional
steps, as encrypted fields can still be used in reports with some limitations. Option C is
incorrect because changing the data type of a field used as an external id from number to
text will not require additional steps, as external id fields can be either number or text. Option
D is incorrect because changing the data type of a field used in lead conversion from number
to text will not require additional steps, as lead conversion fields can be mapped regardless
of their data types."
QUESTION NO: 3,"An app builder installs an unmanaged package in a full copy sandbox that is an exact match
for production, and now they are ready to install it m production. When the app builder
attempts to install the package in production, it fails.
Why did the package fail to install?",A. Incorrect license types,B. Package features not compatible,C. Object limits exceeded,,,,D,"Apex unit test failures can cause a package installation to fail. According to the Salesforce
documentation, ""If your package contains Apex code, all tests must complete successfully for
your package to install."" Incorrect license types, package features not compatible, and object
limits exceeded are not valid reasons for a package installation failure."
QUESTION NO: 4,"Sales reps at Universal Containers use Salesforce on their mobile devices. They want a way
to odd new contacts quickly and then follow up later to complete the additional Information
necessary.
What mobile solution should an App Builder recommend?",A. Customize the mobile menu to move Contacts to the top.,B. Build a global action to create Contacts.,C. Add a compact layout to Contacts.,,,,B,"The app builder should recommend building a global action to create Contacts. A global
action allows users to create records quickly from any page in Salesforce on their mobile
devices. The app builder can also specify predefined values for some fields in the global
action, such as Account Name or Phone Number, to make data entry easier for users. Option
A is incorrect because customizing the mobile menu to move Contacts to the top does not
help users create new contacts quickly or follow up later. Option C is incorrect because
adding a compact layout to Contacts does not help users create new contacts quickly or
follow up later, but rather shows them more fields on record detail pages or list views. Option
D is incorrect because using Path and setting pre-defined values does not help users create
new contacts quickly or follow up later, but rather guides them through different stages of a
record."
QUESTION NO: 5,"Cloud Kicks wants to set up a new opportunity approval process and execute various action
items based on the initial submission.
Which three action types should an app builder use in the approval process?
Choose 3 answers",A. Email Alert,B. Outbound Message,C. Task,D. Invocable Flow,,,"A,C,D","Email alert, task, and invocable flow are three action types that can be used in an approval
process. Email alert can send an email message to one or more recipients. Task can assign
a task to a user or queue. Invocable flow can launch a flow that performs complex logic and
actions"
QUESTION NO: 6,"Cloud Kicks (CK) wants to set up a custom child object to track gift cards issued to a
customer. A key requirement is to track the total number of gift cards opened and gift cards
issued on an Account. CK wants to permanently ensure the gift cards are unable to be
moved across any other Account once it is created.
On the gift card object, what type of field should be created to support this requirement?",A. Master-detail relationship,B. Roll-up summary,C. Formula,,,,A,"The app builder should create a master-detail relationship field on the gift card object to
support the requirement. A master-detail relationship field creates a parent-child relationship
between two objects, where the master record controls certain behaviors of the detail record.
In this case, the Account object would be the master and the gift card object would be the
detail. By creating a master-detail relationship field, the app builder can meet these
requirements:
Track the total number of gift cards opened and gift cards issued on an Account: This can be
done by creating roll-up summary fields on the Account object that count or sum up the
values from the gift card records related to each account.
Permanently ensure the gift cards are unable to be moved across any other Account once it
is created: This can be done by making the master-detail relationship field required on the gift
card object, which means that every gift card record must be associated with an account
record and cannot be changed once set. Option B, C, and D are not types of fields that can
support this requirement."
QUESTION NO: 7,"Universal Containers wants to display the real-time stock price for each Account on the
Account record page.
How should an app builder implement this request?",A. Create a Lightning Web Component.,B. Install a solution from the AppExchange.,C. Build a Flow that uses API calls.,,,,A,"The best way to implement this request is to create a Lightning Web Component that can
fetch the real-time stock price from an external API and display it on the Account record
page. Installing a solution from the AppExchange may not be feasible as it may not match the
exact requirements or may have additional costs. Building a Flow that uses API calls may not
be efficient as it may consume API limits and may not be able to update the stock price in
real-time. Using a scheduled Apex job may not be suitable as it may not be able to run
frequently enough to reflect the real-time stock price"
QUESTION NO: 8,"Universal containers (uc) want to delete data in several fields for 5000 lead records. UC
export the selected record IDs and fields that need to have data deleted in a csv file. Which
two steps should an app builder suggest to meet these requirements? Choose 2 answers",A. Select the correct record type,B. Use import Wizard to update leads using the CSV file,C. Select insert null values in settings.,,,,"C,D","The two steps that should be suggested to meet these requirements are to select insert null
values in settings and to use Data Loader to update leads using the CSV file. Selecting insert
null values in settings will allow Data Loader to overwrite existing values with null values.
Data Loader is a tool that can import, export, update, or delete large amounts of data."
QUESTION NO: 9,"universal containers has several large customers that sell their products through dealers.
Each customer and dealer have an individual rep who works directly with uc and each is
billed separately. How can an app builder implement these requirements?","A. Create a single account record, add each rep as a contact and create a custom dealer object","B. Create both customer and dealer as accounts, add each rep as a contact on the corresponding account and create an account hierarchy.","C. Create a single parent record, add each rep as a contact to the parent account and add each dealer as a child record",,,,D,"Creating both customer and dealer as accounts, creating account teams on each account
and associating the dealer records with the parent account would allow UC to track each
customer and dealer separately, as well as their relationships and reps. Account hierarchy is
not suitable for this scenario, as it is used to show the relationships among parent and child
accounts within a single company"
QUESTION NO: 10,"Cloud Kicks wants to make sure that users without the Marketing role are unable to update
the Contact Retail Opt In picklist field to Yes.
What validation rule would an app builder use to prevent other users from making this
update?","A. AND( $UserRole.Name != 'Marketing',ISCHANGED(Retail_Opt_In__c), ISPICKVAL(Retail_0pt_In_c,""Yes"") )","B. AND( $UserRole.Name != 'Marketing', Retail_Opt_In_c = ""Yes"" )","C. AND( $UserRole.Name = 'Marketing', ISPICKVAL(Retail_Opt_In_c,""Yes"") )",,,,A,"The validation rule should check if the user role is not Marketing, and if the Retail Opt In field
has been changed to Yes. The ISCHANGED function returns true if the field value has been
changed, and the ISPICKVAL function returns true if the field value matches a specified
picklist value."
QUESTION NO: 11,"What should an app builder consider when choosing a template for a new Lightning record
page?",A. The template is unable to be changed after the initial save.,"B. To view the record page, users need ""View All Data"" permissions for the object.",C. A Page structure will automatically adapt to the device being used to view the record page.,,,,C,"A template for a new Lightning record page determines how the page is divided into regions.
The template is responsive and will automatically adapt to the device being used to view the
record page. The template can be changed after the initial save, and users do not need
""View All Data"" permissions for the object"
QUESTION NO: 12,"Universal Containers deployed an app in a large change set from a Developer Sandbox to a
Developer Pro Sandbox used for testing. After testing, changes had to be made to several of
the components in the change set.
How should an app builder move the new changes to the Developer Pro Sandbox?",A. Refresh the text sandbox and re_display the change set.,B. Clone the change set and re_display,"C. Rename the change set, add the changes and re_display",,,,D,"Updating the existing change set with the new changes and redeploying is the most efficient
way to move the updated components to the Developer Pro Sandbox.

QUESTION NO: 13,"The VP of Sales wants a Chatter post to the All-Sales private group when an opportunity
goes to the closed won stage.
What two tools should the app builder use to automate this process? Choose 2 answers",A. Flow,B. Process Builder,C. Big Deal Alert,,,,"B,D","The app builder should use two tools to automate this process:
Process Builder: This is a type of automation tool that can execute actions based on certain
criteria. In this case, the process builder can have a criteria that evaluates if an opportunity

group.
Workflow: This is another type of automation tool that can execute actions based on certain
criteria. In this case, the workflow can have a criteria that evaluates if an opportunity goes to
the closed won stage, and then execute an action that posts a message to a Chatter group.
Option A and C are not tools that can automate this process."
QUESTION NO: 14,What is one limitation of using schema builder when creating a field?,A. Cannot create formula fields.,B. Cannot see existing relationships between objects.,C. Cannot add fields to page layouts.,,,,C,"One of the limitations when using the Schema Builder for creating fields is:
C . Cannot add fields to page layouts. While Schema Builder allows for easy visualization
and creation of fields and objects, it does not support placing these fields onto specific page
layouts directly from the Schema Builder interface.
To place fields on page layouts, you need to:
Navigate to Setup → Object Manager → select your object.
Click on Page Layouts, choose the appropriate layout, and manually add the newly created
fields.
This step is necessary to ensure fields are visible and properly arranged on user interfaces.
For more details, Salesforce's Schema Builder documentation outlines its capabilities and
limitations."
QUESTION NO: 15,"Universal Containers created a 'New Task' custom action on the Opportunity object. The
action was added to all page layouts in the Mobile & Lightning Actions section.
Which Lightning component should the app builder add to the layout to display the action?",A. Related record,B. Related lists,C. Highlights panel,,,,C,"The best Lightning component to add to the layout to display the 'New Task' custom action is
Highlights panel. This component shows key information and actions for a record, such as its
name, owner, and custom actions. Related record, related lists, and activities are not
Lightning components that display custom actions. See [this article] for more information on
Highlights panel."
QUESTION NO: 16,"Universal Containers would like to collaborate with its customers within Salesforce, and has
decided to enable the ""Allow Customer Invitations"" Chatter setting. What permission is

QUESTION NO: 17,"Ursa Major Solar (UMS) uses Cases to track customer complaints, an Issue__c object to
represent known problems with its solar panels, and a Case_Issue__c junction object to
relate known problems to customer complaints.
Periodically, UMS conducts audits which require the auditing users to view Case _Issue__c
records.
Which access levels must be configured to allow UMS users to access Case _Issue_c
records?",A. Read-Only access or issue_c and_issue_c,B. Read-Only access of Case issue =,C. Read Only access on Case and case_issue__o,,,,D,"To ensure auditing users can access records in the Case_Issue__c junction object, the
correct data permissions on related records must be established:
D . Read-Only access on Case and Issue__c. Users need read-only access to both Case and
Issue__c objects to view associated Case_Issue__c junction object records properly. This is
because access to junction object records in Salesforce is determined by the user's access
levels to the parent records in a relationship.
Steps to configure access:
Navigate to Setup → Profiles or Permission Sets.
Select the profile or permission set of the auditing users.
Under Object Settings, adjust the permissions for Case and Issue__c to at least 'Read-Only'.
Ensure that users have visibility to the Case_Issue__c object itself.
This configuration allows users to view the details of cases and issues as they audit the
junction object records."
QUESTION NO: 18,"An app builder at Northern Trad Outfitters created a sandbox template for Accounts, Projects,
and Project Milestones to reconfigure some flows for the project management app.
Which type of testing environment should the app builder create?",A. Developer,B. Partial Copy,C. Developer Pro,,,,B,"Partial Copy is the type of testing environment that the app builder should create to use a
sandbox template for Accounts, Projects, and Project Milestones. According to the
Salesforce documentation, ""Partial Copy sandboxes copy your production org's configuration
(metadata) and some of your production org's data as defined by a sandbox template.""
Developer, Developer Pro, and Scratch Org are not types of testing environments that
support sandbox templates."
QUESTION NO: 19,"Cloud Kicks (CK) increased its Salesforce development efforts so that it now has multiple
custom development efforts happening in parallel. CK's developers and admins perform the
custom (rations and have complained that working in one sandbox has led to many
problems. They requested a solution in which they can work in at least 20 different
sandboxes at once, that all start with the same base configuration and data.
What should an app builder use to solve the problem?",A. Sandbox refreshes,B. Full copy sandboxes,C. Partial copy sandboxes,,,,C,"Partial Copy Sandboxes are ideal for testing and development purposes as they include a
subset of production data and can be refreshed more frequently than Full Copy sandboxes.

QUESTION NO: 20,"Universal Containers (UC) has created a picklist field called Status on three separate custom
objects. UC has a requirement to share the list of values for this field across each object.
Which feature would an app builder use?",A. Field Update,B. Global Picklist Value Set,C. Dynamic Action,,,,B,"The app builder should use a global picklist value set to share the list of values for the Status
field across each object. A global picklist value set is a set of values that can be used by
multiple picklist fields on different objects. This can ensure data consistency and reduce
maintenance efforts. Option A, C, and D are not features that can share picklist values across
objects."
QUESTION NO: 21,"Universal Containers manages leads in a Lead qualification queue where sales reps can
accept ownership of the Lead. Campaign members are required to have a sales owner.
What validation rule should an app builder configure?",A. AND( ISBLANK(Lead.Owner.Id) ),B. NOT(ISNEW() && ISBLANK(Lead.Owner:Queue.Id)),"C. AND(ISNEW(), ISBLANK(Lead.Owner:User.Id))",,,,C,"The validation rule should be AND(ISNEW(), ISBLANK(Lead.Owner:User.Id)). This rule will
prevent saving a new lead record if the owner is not a user. This will ensure that campaign
members have a sales owner. Option A is incorrect because it will prevent saving any lead
record if the owner is blank, which is not the requirement. Option B is incorrect because it will
prevent saving an existing lead record if the owner is a queue, which is not the requirement.
Option D is incorrect because it will prevent saving any lead record if the owner is a queue,
which is not the requirement."
QUESTION NO: 22,"Universal Containers implemented an application process that uses custom objects
Internships and Applications. The organization-wide default for Internships has been set to
private and is the master in the master-detail relationship with Applications. The VP of HR
wants to allow edit access to Applications to recruiters.
How should an app builder configure the proper access?",A. Set the organization-wide default on the Applications object to Read/Write.,B. Add a sharing rule that grants the users Read/Write access to the Internship records.,C. Create a queue for the web applications and assign access to the users who will be editing the records.,,,,D,"The app builder should create a sharing rule that grants the users Read/Write access to the
Application records. A sharing rule is a type of rule that can extend record access to groups
of users based on certain criteria. In this case, the app builder can create a sharing rule that
grants Read/Write access to the Application object to the recruiters based on their role, public
group, or queue. This will allow them to edit the Application records related to any Internship
record, regardless of the ownership. Option A, B, and C are not ways to configure the proper
access."
QUESTION NO: 23,"An app builder has a custom component they want to make available on the utility bar, but
the component is unavailable.
How should the component be tagged?",A. For use on record pages.,B. For use in Lightning App Builder.,C. For use on the utility bar.,,,,C,"To make a custom component available for the utility bar in Salesforce, the component needs
to be explicitly tagged for use in the utility bar. Salesforce components require specific
configurations to be available in different parts of the application, such as the utility bar,
record pages, or app pages.
Option C: For use on the utility bar: When a custom Lightning component is developed, it
must include a specific target tag in its .js-meta.xml configuration file that marks it as usable
in the utility bar. This is done by setting the target to ""lightning__UtilityBar"". Without this tag,
the component will not appear as an option to add to the utility bar in the App Manager.
Example of how the component is tagged in the meta.xml file:
xml
Copy code
<targets>
<target>lightning__UtilityBar</target>
</targets>
Reference:
Option A: For use on record pages: This tag makes the component available only on record
pages, but not the utility bar. The component would have a target for lightning__RecordPage
in this case.
Option B: For use in Lightning App Builder: This option would allow the component to be
used in the Lightning App Builder, but it wouldn't make the component available for the utility
bar. App Builder placement is typically for page layouts.
Option D: For use in App Manager: This is incorrect, as App Manager is used for managing
apps and not for tagging components for availability.
In summary, to make the component available for the utility bar, it needs to be specifically
tagged for that purpose using the lightning__UtilityBar target in the component's metadata
file.

Choose 2 answers",A. Quick Action,B. Approval Process,C. Flow Launcher,,,,"A,C","To allow users access to Flows, Salesforce offers multiple integration points:
A . Quick Action: Flows can be initiated from record pages, the app utility bar, or global
actions using Quick Actions. This allows users to execute flows relevant to specific records or
global processes.
C . Flow Launcher: A component available in Lightning App Builder that enables users to
start flows directly from a Lightning page.
Steps to set up these features:
For Quick Actions, navigate to Setup → Object Manager → select object → Buttons, Links, and

QUESTION NO: 25,"Ursa Major Solar wants to convert the relationship between Galaxy and Star from a lookup
relationship to a master-detail relationship so each Galaxy record can be equipped with a roll-
up summary count of Star records.
Which two considerations should be made?
Choose 2 answers",A. The Star records are all required to have an existing value in their Galaxy field.,B. The Galaxy object has fewer than two existing master-detail relationships.,C. The Galaxy object is required to contain existing roll-up summary fields.,,,,"A,B","The two considerations that should be made are: The Star records are all required to have an
existing value in their Galaxy field. This is a prerequisite for converting a lookup relationship
to a master-detail relationship. A lookup relationship is an optional relationship that links two
objects together, but does not enforce referential integrity or cascade delete. A master-detail
relationship is a required relationship that links two objects together and enforces referential
integrity and cascade delete. To convert a lookup relationship to a master-detail relationship,
all child records must have a value in their lookup field that references an existing parent
record. The Galaxy object has fewer than two existing master-detail relationships. This is
another prerequisite for converting a lookup relationship to a master-detail relationship. An
object can have up to two master-detail relationships with other objects and can act as both
the parent and child in different relationships. To convert a lookup relationship to a master-
detail relationship, the parent object must have fewer than two existing master-detail
relationships with other objects. The Galaxy object is required to contain existing roll-up
summary fields is not a valid consideration, as it is not related to converting a lookup
relationship to a master-detail relationship."
QUESTION NO: 26,"Universal Containers has several new fields they've requested for the Opportunity Product
object.
What should an app builder be able to configure using a formula field?",A. A hyperlink to the parent Account of the parent Opportunity.,B. A Rich Text area field that uses HTML to bold certain characters.,C. A combination of the Opportunity's Text and a Description fields.,,,,C,"Formula fields in Salesforce can use various functions including text, mathematical, and
logical functions to create simple or complex expressions. They can handle data from fields
of the same record. Option C, ""A combination of the Opportunity's Text and a Description
fields,"" is a valid configuration for a formula field as it involves simple concatenation of text
fields, which is supported.
Options A, B, and D exceed the capabilities of formula fields:
A: Hyperlinks to other objects using formula fields do not directly support navigation to parent
records of a different object.
B: Rich Text and HTML formatting are not supported in formula fields.
D: Formula fields have limits in their complexity and field references which would make
mixing numerous fields from different related objects impractical and likely exceed formula
size limits.

QUESTION NO: 34,"Universal Container wants customers to be able to open cases from a public-facing website.
What should the app builder use to enable visitors to the website?",A. Outbound message,B. Web-to-case,C. Screen flow,,,,B,"The app builder should use Web-to-Case to enable visitors to the website to open cases.
Web-to-Case is a feature that allows users to create an HTML form that can be embedded
into a public-facing website. When visitors fill out and submit the form, a new case is
automatically created in Salesforce with the information from the form fields. Web-to-Case
can also assign cases to queues or users based on predefined rules and criteria. Outbound
message is not a valid tool, as it does not enable visitors to open cases. An outbound
message is a type of workflow action that sends a secure XML message to a designated
endpoint URL when a record meets certain criteria. An outbound message can be used to
integrate Salesforce with external systems or applications. Screen flow is not a valid tool, as
it does not enable visitors to open cases from a public-facing website. A screen flow is a type
of flow that allows users to create an interactive guided process that can collect, display, and
update data from multiple objects within Salesforce. A screen flow can be embedded into
Lightning pages or Visualforce pages, but it cannot be exposed to unauthenticated users on
a public website. Email-to-Case is not a valid tool, as it does not enable visitors to open
cases from a website. Email-to-Case is a feature that allows users to create cases from email
messages sent to a specific email address. Email-to-Case can also capture email
attachments and thread information and associate them with the case."

QUESTION NO: 44,"Cloud Kicks asked the app builder to insert a list of 25,000 records using deduplication for the
Race_Track__c customobject.
Which tool should be used?",A. Import Wizard,B. Lightning Object Creator,C. Data Loader,,,,C,"Cloud Kicks needs to insert 25,000 records with deduplication for the Race_Track__c custom
object. Here's the reasoning for choosing Data Loader:
Data Loader: This is the appropriate tool for importing large volumes of data (up to 5 million
records) into Salesforce. It also provides deduplication options through Salesforce's native
matching rules or by implementing external checks. Data Loader is highly scalable, and for
25,000 records, it is well-suited because it can handle more than the Import Wizard's record
limits.
Option A (Import Wizard): The Import Wizard is not a good choice here because it supports
up to 50,000 records, which may seem acceptable. However, it is generally recommended for
smaller data imports, and deduplication options are limited compared to what Data Loader
offers. Additionally, for bulk operations like 25,000 records, Data Loader is more efficient and
robust.
Reference:
Option B (Lightning Object Creator): This tool is used to create custom objects from
spreadsheets and is not designed for bulk data loading or deduplication. It's not appropriate
for large data imports.
Option D (Schema Builder): Schema Builder is a tool used to view and modify the structure of
objects and fields in Salesforce, not for data import or deduplication purposes.
In summary, Data Loader is the most appropriate tool for importing a large number of records
with deduplication needs.

QUESTION NO: 45,"Cloud Kicks has three types of customer support processes: Platinum, Diamond, and Bronze.
The app builder created separate record types for each process on the Case object. The
customer support team should be unable to create new cases with the Bronze record type.
How should this requirement be met?",A. Update the organization-wide defaults to private for Case.,B. Update the support team profile to remove the Bronze record type.,C. Create permission set group for Case that includes Platinum and Diamond record types.,,,,B,"The solution that should meet this requirement is updating the support team profile to remove
the Bronze record type. This way, the support team users will not be able to create new
cases with the Bronze record type, as it will not appear in their record type selection list.
Option A is incorrect because updating the organization-wide defaults to private for Case
does not affect the record type availability, but rather the record access level. Option C is
incorrect because creating permission set group for Case that includes Platinum and
Diamond record types does not prevent the support team users from creating new cases with
the Bronze record type, as they may still have access to it through their profile. Option D is
incorrect because making the record type hidden to support users and updating sharing roles
to private does not prevent the support team users from creating new cases with the Bronze
record type, as they may still have access to it through their profile."
QUESTION NO: 46,"Northern Trail Outfitters wants to change a master-detail relationship on Account to a lookup
relationship with a custom object Park. The app builder tries to reconfigure this but is unable
to do so.
What could be causing this?",A. The Account is included in a flow process on the Park object.,B. The Park object needs at least one Master-Detail field for reporting.,C. The Account record includes Parks roll-up summary fields.,,,,C,"When attempting to change a master-detail relationship to a lookup relationship, Salesforce
imposes specific restrictions to maintain data integrity:
C . The Account record includes Parks roll-up summary fields. Master-detail relationships
allow roll-up summary fields to aggregate data from child records onto the parent record. If
any roll-up summary fields are present on the master object (Account in this case) that
depend on the detail records (Parks), the relationship cannot be changed to lookup until
these roll-up summary fields are removed.
To resolve this, follow these steps:
Identify and delete all roll-up summary fields on the Account object that reference the Park
object.
Convert the master-detail relationship to a lookup relationship.
Recreate any necessary roll-ups using declarative tools like Process Builder or Flow if
needed, as lookups do not support native roll-up summaries.
For more guidance, review Salesforce's documentation on Changing Field Types."
QUESTION NO: 47,"An app builder wants to create a formula field on an Account to include data from related
Contacts but is unable to find the relationship in the formula editor.
What is a limitation of formulas that could be causing the issue?",A. Unable to reference the child records.,B. A master-detail relationship should be created.,C. Formula field limit reached on the Account object.,,,,A,"The app builder wants to create a formula field on an Account to include data from related
Contacts but cannot find the relationship in the formula editor. This limitation occurs because
formula fields in Salesforce cannot reference child records directly.
Option A (Unable to reference the child records): In Salesforce, formula fields can reference
parent objects but not child objects. In this case, Contacts are child records of Accounts in a
lookup relationship, and Account is the parent. This is why the formula editor does not
provide access to the child records (Contacts) from the Account.
Reference:
Option B (A master-detail relationship should be created): While master-detail relationships
allow for roll-up summaries, creating a master-detail relationship is not applicable here since
the standard Account-Contact relationship is a lookup, and changing it to master-detail is not
possible.
Option C (Formula field limit reached on the Account object): This would limit the number of
formulas but is not the root cause of the issue described.
Option D (More than 5,000 characters in the formula): This limit refers to formula field
complexity, but it does not explain the inability to reference child records.
In summary, the limitation is due to Salesforce not allowing formula fields to reference child
records.

costs down.
What type of sandbox should each team member use?",A. Full sandbox,B. Developer sandbox,C. Developer pro sandbox,,,,B,"The best type of sandbox for each team member to use is a developer sandbox. A developer
sandbox is a copy of production that includes only the metadata, such as objects, fields,
layouts, etc. It does not include any data, such as records or attachments. A developer
sandbox is ideal for small projects that do not require data testing, such as developing new
features or customizations. A developer sandbox has a storage limit of 200 MB and can be
refreshed once per day. A developer sandbox is also cheaper than other types of sandboxes.
A full sandbox is a copy of production that includes all the metadata and data. It is ideal for
large projects that require data testing, such as performance testing or integration testing. A
full sandbox has the same storage limit as production and can be refreshed every 29 days. A
full sandbox is also the most expensive type of sandbox. A developer pro sandbox is similar
to a developer sandbox, but it has a larger storage limit of 1 GB and can be refreshed every 5
days. It is ideal for projects that require some data testing, such as data migration or quality

QUESTION NO: 109,"Cloud Kicks (CK) wants to simultaneously delete a Supplier's record and all Supplier ltem__c
records if a partnership ends with a supplier.
What solution could an app builder use to meet the requirement?",A. Many-to-many,B. Indirect lookup,C. Hierarchical,,,,D,"The solution that an app builder should use to meet this requirement is master-detail
relationship. A master-detail relationship is a type of relationship that creates a parent-child
relationship between two objects, where the child records inherit the sharing and security
settings of their parent record. The app builder can create a master-detail relationship
between Supplier__c and SupplierItem__c objects, where Supplier__c is the parent object
and SupplierItem__c is the child object. This way, when a Supplier__c record is deleted, all
related SupplierItem__c records are also deleted automatically. Option A is incorrect because
many-to-many relationship is not suitable for this requirement, as many-to-many relationship
allows two objects to be linked in both directions through a junction object, but does not
support cascading delete. Option B is incorrect because indirect lookup relationship is not
suitable for this requirement, as indirect lookup relationship allows an external object to link
with another object using an external ID field, but does not support cascading delete. Option
C is incorrect because hierarchical relationship is not suitable for this requirement, as
hierarchical relationship allows users to use a lookup field that links an object with itself, but
does not support cascading delete."
QUESTION NO: 110,"An app builder needs to create new automation on an object.
What best practice should the app builder follow when building out automation?",A. One Workflow rule per object.,B. One Flow per object.,C. One invocable process per object.,,,,D,"The best practice that the app builder should follow when building out automation is one
record change process per object. A record change process is a type of process in Process
Builder that starts when a record is created or updated. Having one record change process
per object can avoid conflicts or errors when multiple processes try to update the same
record at the same time. Option A is incorrect because one workflow rule per object is not a
best practice, as workflow rules are considered legacy tools and have limitations compared to
Process Builder. Option B is incorrect because one flow per object is not a best practice, as
flows are more complex and require more resources than processes. Option C is incorrect
because one invocable process per object is not a best practice, as invocable processes are
used to invoke other processes from within a process or a flow."

Utilize the manage assignments button to assign a permission set group and additional individual permission sets to each user.,B. Utilize the manage assignments button to assign each user with the same set of permission set groups and permission sets.,C. Utilize the Data Import Wizard to mass update the desired users with their full list of permission sets and permission set groups.,,,,A,"The app builder should recommend utilizing the manage assignments button to assign a
permission set group and additional individual permission sets to each user. This way, the
app builder can assign the five consistent permission sets to all users in one permission set

Create a formula field on the Account object using the ISPICKVAL function.,C. Create a Process Builder and use a field update on the Case object.,,,,A,"Create a formula field on the Case object using the TEXT function. This is correct because a
formula field can reference a field from a related object using dot notation, and the TEXT
function can convert a picklist value to text. This way, the case record will always show the
current value of the Support Level field on the account record."
QUESTION NO: 117,"Universal Containers has two types of applicants, hourly and salary. There are separate
record types for each. While all members of the human resource department need to be able

QUESTION NO: 120,"DreamHouse Realty (DR) employees started using company-owned airplanes for work travel
after Ursa Major Solar was acquired. DR executives want to automate the submission travel
request forms to enforce the Internal policy.
How should an app builder automate travel requests based on these criteria?",A. Process Builder,B. Workflow rule,C. Approval process,,,,C,"Approval process is the best way to automate travel requests based on internal policy.
Approval process can define the steps, criteria, and actions for approving records. The app
builder can create an approval process for travel requests that requires approval from

are not suitable for this requirement."
QUESTION NO: 121,"After universal containers converted qualified leads. Sales reps need to be able to report on
converted leads. How should an app builder support for this requirement?",A. Enable preserve lead status in the lead conversion settings,B. Assign the representative view and edit converted leads permission,C. Ensure the representative has read access to the original lead records,,,,D,"The solution that an app builder should use to meet this requirement is creating a custom
report type with converted leads as the primary object. A custom report type is a template
that defines the objects and fields that are available for a report. The app builder can create a
custom report type that has converted leads as the primary object and includes fields from
related objects, such as accounts, contacts, and opportunities. This way, sales reps can
create reports on converted leads and see their related information. Option A is incorrect
because enabling preserve lead status in the lead conversion settings does not affect the
reporting on converted leads, but rather allows users to retain the original lead status after
conversion. Option B is incorrect because assigning the representative view and edit
converted leads permission does not affect the reporting on converted leads, but rather
allows users to view and edit converted lead records. Option C is incorrect because ensuring
the representative has read access to the original lead records does not affect the reporting
on converted leads, but rather allows users to view the original lead records."
QUESTION NO: 122,"A custom field on an account is used to track finance information about a customer. Only

Create a new profile to allow for read-only access to the field via Field Level Security and assign it to the agent,C. Update the Customer Service Profile already assigned to the agent to allow for read-only access to the field via Field Level Security,,,,A,"The recommended solution to grant the customer service agent access to the field is creating
a permission set that allows read-only access to the field via Field Level Security and
assigning it to the agent. A permission set is a collection of settings and permissions that give
users access to various tools and functions. Field Level Security (FLS) is a setting that
controls the access level of fields for different profiles or permission sets. The app builder can
create a permission set that grants read-only access to the custom field on the account
object via FLS and assign it to the agent. Option B is incorrect because creating a new profile
to allow for read-only access to the field via FLS and assigning it to the agent is not
recommended, as profiles are used to define the baseline permissions and settings for a
group of users, and creating multiple profiles for individual users can be hard to maintain.
Option C is incorrect because updating the Customer Service Profile already assigned to the
agent to allow for read-only access to the field via FLS is not recommended, as this will affect
all users who have the same profile, which may violate the security policy. Option D is
incorrect because updating the custom field's FLS in setup to allow the agent read-only
access to the field is not possible, as FLS can only be set at the profile or permission set
level, not at the user level."

C)",A. Option A,B. Option B,C. Option C,,,,B,"For a formula to evaluate to true when the stage is set to ""Negotiation/Review"" and the close
date is less than one week away, the correct formula is:
Option B. This formula uses the ISPICKVAL function to check the text value of a picklist and

AND( I AND(
ISPICKVAL(StageName, ""Negotiation/Review""),
CloseDate - 7 < TODAY()

This formula checks that both conditions are met: it confirms the stage name is
""Negotiation/Review"" and that the CloseDate is within the next 7 days from the current date.
Option A lacks the ISPICKVAL function necessary for evaluating picklist fields. Option C uses
DAY(7) which is not a valid Salesforce formula expression. Option D also uses DAY(7)

QUESTION NO: 148,"DreamHouse Realty (DR) asks for some improvements in case management. They want to
enforce process compliance so that cases are unable to be reverted to an earlier case status,
and to ensure that certain fields are required when specific case criteria are met.
Which solution should an app builder implement to meet these requirements?",A. Configure validation rules with help text.,B. Create dependent picklist fields and set them as required.,C. Use an approval process to check field criteria are met.,,,,A,"To ensure process compliance where cases cannot revert to an earlier status and certain
fields are required based on specific case criteria, the recommended solution is:
Configure validation rules with help text (A). Validation rules enforce data integrity and
business processes by preventing users from saving records if certain conditions are not met.
For instance, a validation rule can prevent the status of a case from being changed back to
an earlier status and can conditionally require fields based on other field values on the case.
Dependent picklists (B) ensure field values depend on another field's value but do not
enforce the inability to revert status. Approval processes (C) are used for step-by-step record
approval and are not designed to prevent status reversion or conditionally require fields.
Making fields required on the page layout (D) ensures they are always required when
accessing the record through that layout but does not enforce conditional requirements
based on other criteria.

How should the app builder satisfy this requirement?",A. Classic encryption,B. Filtered view,C. Field-level security,,,,C,"To restrict visibility of the Jupiter field on the Solar System object specifically to users with the
Outer Planets profile:
C . Field-level security (FLS). This allows the app builder to control access to fields based on
user profiles.
Steps to set up field-level security:
Navigate to Setup → Object Manager → Solar System.
Select Fields & Relationships → Jupiter field.
Click Field-Level Security.
For all profiles except Outer Planets, set the Visible option to unchecked, ensuring these
users cannot see the field.

QUESTION NO: 151,"An app builder wants to create a report to compare the number of support cases in each
status (New, In-progress, or Closed) and by priority (Critical, High, Medium, or Low).
What solution should be used for the report?",A. Grouping,B. Bucket Columns,C. Custom Report Type,,,,A,"The best solution to create a report to compare the number of support cases in each status
and by priority is to use grouping. Grouping allows the app builder to summarize data by one
or more fields, such as status and priority, and display them in rows and columns. Grouping
also enables the app builder to use different chart types, such as stacked bar charts or matrix
charts, to visualize the data. Bucket columns are not a suitable solution, as they are used to
categorize data into predefined groups, such as high, medium, or low. Custom report types
are not a suitable solution, as they are used to define the objects and fields available for a
report, not how to display them. Filters are not a suitable solution, as they are used to limit
the data shown in a report based on certain criteria, not how to compare them"

Grant read-only access to all report profiles.,,,,D,"When creating a new field, if an app builder does not want the field to be automatically added
to pre-existing custom report types, the step to take is:
Deselect 'Add Field to Custom Report Types' (D). This option is available when creating or
editing a custom field and ensures that the field is not automatically included in report types
where 'Automatically add new custom fields to report type layouts' is enabled.
Removing the field from page layouts (A) affects the visibility on record pages but not reports.

QUESTION NO: 154,"Cloud Kicks received a new requirement to calculate summaries from child objects of a
standard object. The team would prefer to solve this declaratively.
What are two considerations an app builder should evaluate?
Choose 2 answers",A. An app builder is unable to change a look up to a master-detail relationship.,B. An object can have up to two master-detail relationships.,C. A trigger on save or update can kick off calculations.,,,,"B,D","When Cloud Kicks needs to calculate summaries from child objects of a standard object
declaratively, a few key considerations about master-detail relationships come into play.
Master-detail relationships are critical in Salesforce when working with roll-up summary
fields, which allow you to calculate values from child records.
Option B: An object can have up to two master-detail relationships.
Salesforce allows an object to have two master-detail relationships. This is important
because if you want to aggregate child record data using roll-up summary fields, you need to
have a master-detail relationship in place. Each master-detail relationship links a child object
to a parent, and you can create roll-up summary fields on the parent object to summarize the
child record data.
Reference:
Option D: A value is required in all records of the lookup field prior to converting to a master-
detail relationship.
One important consideration when converting a lookup relationship into a master-detail
relationship is that the lookup field must contain values for all existing child records. This is
because master-detail relationships have tighter coupling between parent and child records,
and a child cannot exist without a parent in a master-detail scenario. Thus, the field cannot
be null during the conversion process.
Option A: An app builder can convert a lookup relationship to a master-detail relationship if
the above condition (that all lookup fields are populated) is met, so this option is incorrect.
Option C: Triggers are part of custom development using Apex, and the question specifies
the solution should be declarative. Therefore, triggers would not be a relevant declarative tool
for this scenario."
QUESTION NO: 155,"Accounts at Universal Containers are currently readable by all users but editable only by their
owners. Management wants to designate some Accounts as VIP Accounts. Only Account
owners should have read access to these VIP accounts.
Which two actions should an app builder take to meet the requirements?
Choose 2 answers",A. Implement a sharing rule.,B. Configure a permission set.,C. Set up an Account Team.,,,,"A,D","The two actions that an app builder should take to meet the requirements are: Implement a
sharing rule. A sharing rule is a way to grant additional access to records based on certain
criteria, such as record owner, role, profile, or field value. The app builder can create a
sharing rule that grants read access to all accounts with the VIP Account field value to all
users. This way, all users can view these accounts, but only the owners can edit them.
Change organization-wide defaults. Organization-wide defaults are the baseline level of
access that users have to records they do not own. The app builder can change the
organization-wide default for accounts from Public Read Only to Private. This way, only the
owners can view and edit their own accounts, unless additional access is granted by other
means, such as sharing rules. Configuring a permission set is not a valid action, as it does
not affect record-level access. A permission set is a way to grant additional permissions and
access settings to users on top of their profile settings, such as object permissions, field
permissions, app permissions, etc. Setting up an Account Team is not a valid action, as it
does not restrict record-level access. An Account Team is a way to share an account and its
related records with a group of users who work together on the account, such as sales reps,
managers, or support agents. An Account Team grants additional access to team members

Users should be logged out of production when receiving inbound change sets.,,,,"B,C","The two considerations that an app builder should keep in mind during the deployment
process using change sets are: Change sets do not include all components and may have to
perform some changes manually. Change sets are a way to deploy metadata changes from
one Salesforce org to another, but they do not support all types of components, such as
reports, dashboards, email templates, etc. The app builder may have to use other methods,
such as unmanaged packages or manual configuration, to deploy these components. Users
should be logged out of production when receiving inbound change sets. This is a best
practice to avoid any errors or conflicts that may occur when deploying changes to
production. Users may be working on records or components that are being updated by the
change set, which may cause data loss or inconsistency. Salesforce Connect does not
automatically establish a link between environments. Salesforce Connect is a feature that
allows users to access data from external sources without storing it in Salesforce. It does not
have anything to do with deploying changes between Salesforce orgs. Transactions will not
revert if the deployment errors. Transactions are units of work that are either completed

QUESTION NO: 188,"Universal Containers allows all employees to submit reviews for leadership using a custom
object called Review. These Reviews should only be visible to the HR department and the
employee who submitted the record.
Which three steps should an app builder take to properly control access to Reviews?
Choose 3 answers",A. Disable Grant Access Using Hierarchies.,B. Add a Master-Detail (User; field on the Review object.,C. Create a criteria-based Sharing Rule for the HR Department.,D. Remove Review Read permission from non-HR Department user Profiles.,,,"A,C,E","To control access to the Review custom object such that only the HR department and the
submitting employee can see the reviews, the following steps should be taken:
A: Disable Grant Access Using Hierarchies:
By default, Salesforce allows users higher in the role hierarchy to access records owned by
users lower in the hierarchy. Since reviews should only be visible to HR and the submitting
employee, you need to disable Grant Access Using Hierarchies on the Review object to
prevent anyone else in the hierarchy from automatically gaining access to these records.
Reference:
C: Create a criteria-based Sharing Rule for the HR Department:
With the organization-wide default (OWD) set to Private, you'll need to create a criteria-based
sharing rule to ensure that HR users can view the Review records. This rule would give HR
access to the records based on a specified condition, such as all records of the Review
object.
E: Set organization-wide default to Private:
Setting the organization-wide default (OWD) for the Review object to Private ensures that no
user, other than the record owner (the submitting employee) and those explicitly granted
access (HR), can see the Review records by default.
Why the other options are incorrect:
Option B: Add a Master-Detail (User) field on the Review object:
This is not necessary in this scenario because the primary relationship is about controlling
access through sharing rules, not creating a master-detail relationship. Moreover, this would
complicate access control, which is better managed via sharing settings.
Option D: Remove Review Read permission from non-HR Department user Profiles:
This step is redundant if the organization-wide default is set to Private. Profile permissions
control the general ability to access the object, while the visibility of specific records is
controlled by sharing rules and OWD. Removing read access via profiles would block all
users, including the ones submitting the reviews, from accessing the object.
In summary, by disabling Grant Access Using Hierarchies, setting OWD to Private, and
implementing a criteria-based sharing rule for HR, you can ensure that only HR and the
submitting employee can view Review records.

actions that allow users to create records or perform tasks from anywhere in Salesforce.
They are displayed in various places in Salesforce mobile app, such as action bar, action
menu, or publisher. By using global actions, the app builder can make it easy for the
appraisal team to perform common tasks on mobile, such as creating a new appraisal record
or logging a call.
Minimize the amount of formula fields and lookup fields to reduce page load time: Formula
fields and lookup fields are types of fields that can affect the performance of Salesforce
mobile app. Formula fields are fields that calculate a value based on an expression or
formula. Lookup fields are fields that create a relationship between two objects and allow
users to select a value from a list of records. Both types of fields can increase the page load
time on mobile devices, especially if they are complex or reference many other fields. By
minimizing the amount of formula fields and lookup fields, the app builder can optimize the
mobile experience for the appraisal team.
Put the most important fields in the compact layout so they are easy to find: Compact layouts
are layouts that display a record's key information at a glance. They are used in various
places in Salesforce mobile app, such as record highlights, list views, related lists, and
lookup dialogs. By putting the most important fields in the compact layout, the app builder
can ensure that the appraisal team can easily find the information they need on mobile
devices. Option B and D are not things that an app builder should do to optimize mobile
experience."

The Read/Write radio button, Allows users with at least Read/Write access to the Master record to create, edit, or delete related Detail records, is selected.",,,,B,"The issue described occurs due to the settings in the master-detail relationship. Specifically:
The Allow reparenting checkbox, Child records can be reparented to other parent records
after they are created, is unchecked (B). This setting prevents changing the parent record
(contact) of a child record (service plan) once it has been set. If 'Allow reparenting' is
unchecked, it restricts the ability to change the associated contact, leading to the issue
observed.
The other options do not directly address the inability to change the associated contact on a
service plan record. The 'Read Only' and 'Read/Write' settings (A and C) pertain to access
rights to the detail records based on the master record's access but do not affect the ability to
reparent a record.

B . Create a validation rule on Contact. This rule can enforce that the Region field must be
filled out for Contacts related to Accounts marked as 'High Priority'.
Steps to create this validation rule:
Navigate to Setup → Object Manager → Contact → Validation Rules.
Create a new validation rule.
In the formula, use:
AND(
ISPICKVAL(Account.Customer_Status__c, 'High Priority'),
ISBLANK(Region__c)

automation that can invoke a Flow when a record is created or updated. By using these two
tools, the app builder can create a solution that can query the number of open cases for the
account and parent account and display them on the account page using a screen element.
Workflow is not a suitable tool, as it cannot query or display data from multiple objects. It can

How should an app builder implement this requirement?",A. Create a formula field on the Case object using the TEXT function.,B. Create a formula field on the Account object using the ISPICKVAL function.,C. Create a Process Builder and use a field update on the Case object.,,,,A,"The best way to implement this requirement is to create a formula field on the Case object
using the TEXT function. A formula field can display the value of another field from a related
object, such as the Account object. The TEXT function can convert a picklist value into text,
which can be displayed on the Case record. Creating a formula field on the Account object
using the ISPICKVAL function is not a valid solution, as it does not show the value of Support
Level on the Case record. The ISPICKVAL function is used to check if a picklist field has a
certain value, not to display it. Creating a Process Builder and using a field update on the
Case object is not an optimal solution, as it requires more configuration and maintenance
than a formula field. A Process Builder may also introduce delays or errors in updating the
field value. Creating a roll-up summary field using Support Level on the Account object is not
a valid solution, as it does not show the value of Support Level on the Case record. A roll-up
summary field is used to aggregate numeric values from child records, not to display picklist

Which type of sandbox should be used to accomplish this?",A. Developer Pro,B. Partial Copy,C. Full Copy,,,,B,"To test code against a subset of production data under 5 GB and to refresh the sandbox
environment weekly, the most suitable type of sandbox is:
Partial Copy (B). A Partial Copy sandbox includes a copy of your production org's metadata

GB of data and can be refreshed every 5 days, making it ideal for scenarios where a
representative sample of production data is needed for testing without the storage and
refresh limitations of a Full Copy sandbox.
Developer Pro (A) and Developer (D) sandboxes also allow for testing and development but
do not include a subset of production data-they either have no data or only limited sample
data. A Full Copy sandbox (C) provides a full replica of production data, far exceeding the 5

Which two actions should an app builder take to accomplish this requirement?
Choose 2 answers",A. Use a formula field on the Park record to show the total number of trails.,B. Use a roll-up summary field on the Park record to show the total number of Trails.,C. Use a master-detail relationship between the Park and Trail objects.,,,,"B,C","To track the total number of trails associated with a park without writing code, the correct
actions to take are:
Use a roll-up summary field on the Park record to show the total number of Trails (B). Roll-up
summary fields calculate and display a value in a master record based on the values of fields
in a detail record. They are used to count, sum, average, or get the minimum/maximum of
values in related detail records.
Use a master-detail relationship between the Park and Trail objects (C). Master-detail
relationships are necessary for roll-up summary fields as they allow the master object to
control certain behaviors of the detail object and summarize data from those detail records.
A formula field (A) cannot dynamically count related records unless those records are linked
via a master-detail relationship, and it cannot alone handle counts across related records
without such a relationship. A lookup relationship (D) does not support roll-up summaries
unless combined with additional tools like triggers or third-party apps, which involve coding or
extra configuration outside standard object setup.

QUESTION NO: 256,"Cloud Kicks wants to summarize the number of open Cases related to an Account, as well as
the number of closed Cases to indicate whether customer support utilization is high, medium,
or low. Two number fields have been created: NUM_Open_Cases__c and
NUM_Closed_Cases_c Which two automation solutions would meet these business
requirements?
Choose 2 answers",A. AppExchange,B. Validation Rule,C. Approval Process,,,,"A,D","To meet the requirement of summarizing the number of open and closed cases on an
Account, two potential automation solutions can be used:
Option A (AppExchange): Salesforce AppExchange offers various pre-built apps and
components, including those for case management, which could provide the functionality to
summarize cases and categorize customer support utilization. Many apps can handle
complex business requirements like case summary roll-ups and could meet the needs
without custom development.
Reference:
Option D (Apex): Apex is Salesforce's programming language that allows developers to
implement custom logic. In this scenario, Apex could be used to create a trigger or scheduled
job that calculates the number of open and closed cases and updates the Account record
accordingly. Apex would allow full customization of how the open/closed case numbers are
calculated and how customer support utilization (high, medium, low) is determined.
Option B (Validation Rule): Validation Rules enforce data quality by ensuring that certain
conditions are met before saving a record. They are not suitable for summarizing data or
performing calculations across related records, so this option is not appropriate.
Option C (Approval Process): Approval Processes are used for managing approval
workflows, which is unrelated to the case summarization requirement. Therefore, it is not a
relevant option here.
In summary, using AppExchange for a pre-built solution or Apex for a custom automation are
the best approaches for summarizing open and closed cases on the Account object.

can write detailed descriptions that can include pictures and links. The Rich Text Area field
type is the best fit for this requirement.
Option B (Rich Text Area): A Rich Text Area field allows users to enter text with formatting
options such as bold, italics, bullets, and numbering. Additionally, it supports inserting images
and hyperlinks, which matches the requirement of including pictures and links in the
description.
Reference:
Option A (Long Text Area): A Long Text Area field allows for lengthy text input but does not
support formatting or embedding of images and links, which are necessary in this case.
Option C (Multi-Select Picklist): A Multi-Select Picklist allows users to select multiple values
from a list but is not suitable for detailed descriptions or embedding images and links.
Option D (URL): A URL field is used to store and display a link but does not support text input
or embedding images.
In summary, the Rich Text Area field type should be used because it allows formatted text,
images, and links, which are required for the Planet Details field.

Relationships can be made to any custom objects, but any relationships to standard objects should be built in Lightning Object Manager.",,,,B,"It lacks setting up field-level security and adding fields to the page layout, so you have to
choose the manual way of field creation. Adds another layer of risk with changes in Schema
Builder since it is deployed in real-time.
Salesforce Schema Builder is a powerful tool for visualizing and creating objects, fields, and
relationships in Salesforce, but it has certain limitations when building custom objects.
Option B (Fields and relationships can be created, but they will be unable to add the fields to
the page layout from the canvas): In Schema Builder, while you can create new custom
objects, fields, and relationships, you cannot directly add fields to the page layout from within
the Schema Builder interface. After creating a field, you need to navigate to the Page Layout
Editor to manually place the new field on the layout.
Reference:
Option A: This is incorrect because you can perform multiple actions within Schema Builder
without needing to click Save each time. Salesforce will save these changes when you click
Save once at the end.
Option C: While relationships can be created in Schema Builder for both standard and
custom objects, there is no requirement to use Lightning Object Manager to create
relationships with standard objects.
Option D: Schema Builder supports the creation of formula fields along with other types of
fields. There is no exclusion for formula fields.
In summary, Option B is the correct limitation of Schema Builder: you cannot add fields to
page layouts directly from the Schema Builder interface.

QUESTION NO: 280,"The sales Operations team at AWS Computing deletes accounts for a variety of a reasons.
The sales ops director is worried that the Sales team may delete accounts that sales reps are
actively selling into.
Now should the app builder keep accounts with open opportunities from being deleted?",A. Create an Apex Trigger on the Account object,B. Create a validation rule on the Account object.,C. Remove the delete button on the account layout,,,,B,"Create a validation rule on the Account object is how the app builder can keep accounts with
open opportunities from being deleted. According to the Salesforce documentation,
""Validation rules verify that data entered by users in records meet the standards you specify
before they can save it."" A validation rule can check if an account has any open opportunities
and display an error message if someone tries to delete it. Create an Apex trigger on the
Account object, remove the delete button on the account layout, and remove the Delete
permission from the Sales Rep profile are not valid or sufficient solutions for this requirement."
QUESTION NO: 281,"Universal Containers is setting up salesforce for the first time. Management wants the sales
and marketing teams to have different navigation names in the salesforce1 mobile app.

Create roles for sales and marketing and assign a custom homepage layout for each role.,C. Create mobile navigation menus for both the sales and marketing profiles.,,,,C,"Create mobile navigation menus for both the sales and marketing profiles. This is correct
because mobile navigation menus allow users to customize the items that appear in the

Once the required fields are populated, use a sharing rule to share the new fields with the user.",,,,A,"Making the Opportunity type a required field on the initial Opportunity page layout and using
automation to fill in the type field to a record type is a way to limit the number of fields users
are required to fill out when creating a new Opportunity. This way, the app builder can assign
different page layouts for different record types based on the Opportunity type. The other
options are not feasible or effective"
QUESTION NO: 283,"Universal Containers uses a custom picklist field Account Region on the account record.
They want this region to be reflected on all related contact records and stay in sync if the
value of this field changes on the Account.

Create a picklist field called 'Account Region' on Contact object > Create a workflow rule to update this picklist field if the Account Region field on the Account is changed.,B. Create a formula field on the Contact object > Set the value of the formula to ISPICKVAL(Account.Account_Region__c).,C. Create a formula field on the Contact object > Set the value of the formula to TEXT(Account.Account_Region__c).,,,,C,"Creating a formula field on the Contact object and setting the value of the formula to
TEXT(Account.Account_Region__c) would reflect the region of the related account on the
contact record and stay in sync if the value changes on the account. This is the most efficient
and maintainable way to meet the requirement. Creating a workflow rule or a picklist field
would require additional configuration and complexity"
QUESTION NO: 284,"Ursa Major Solar's sales team has been struggling to enter data on mobile since rollout; the
team dislikes scrolling through all of the fields to input only the necessary data.
How could the app builder solve this with minimal impact to desktop users?",A. Filter components by device using Form Factor.,B. Reorder the fields to make sense for the reps when in the field.,C. Update the training documentation with better screenshots.,,,,A,"The best way to solve this problem is to filter components by device using Form Factor. Form
Factor is an attribute that can be applied to components on a Lightning record page to control
their visibility based on the device type, such as desktop, phone, or tablet. By using Form
Factor, the app builder can hide some components that are not relevant for mobile users,
such as charts or reports, and show only the components that are necessary for data entry,
such as fields or actions. This way, the mobile users do not have to scroll through all the
components and can enter data more easily. Reordering the fields may not solve the problem
completely, as there may still be too many components on the page for mobile users.
Updating the training documentation may not help either, as it does not address the root
cause of the problem, which is the layout of the page. Deselecting the phone radio button on
the Lightning record page assignment may not be desirable, as it will prevent mobile users
from accessing the record page at all, which may affect their productivity and functionality."
QUESTION NO: 285,"At Universal Containers, the VP of Service has requested a visual indicator flag on each

refreshed weekly the confidential objects, and can be refreshed weekly.
What steps should an App Builder take to meet these requirements?",A. Create a Full Sandbox and use a sandbox template,B. Create a Developer Pro Sandbox and schedule Data loader to download selected object data weekly.,C. Create a Partial Copy Sandbox and use a sandbox template.,,,,C,"The steps that the app builder should take to meet these requirements are creating a Partial
Copy Sandbox and using a sandbox template. A Partial Copy Sandbox can include data
records, exclude confidential objects, and be refreshed weekly. A sandbox template can
specify which objects and data are copied from the production org to the sandbox org. Option
A is incorrect because creating a Full Sandbox and using a sandbox template is not
necessary for this requirement, as Full Sandboxes copy all data and metadata from the
production org and can only be refreshed every 29 days. Option B is incorrect because
creating a Developer Pro Sandbox and scheduling Data Loader to download selected object
data weekly is not feasible for this requirement, as Developer Pro Sandboxes do not include
data records by default and Data Loader cannot be scheduled to run weekly. Option D is
incorrect because creating a Developer Sandbox and scheduling Data Loader to download
selected object data weekly is not feasible for this requirement, as Developer Sandboxes do
not include data records by default and Data Loader cannot be scheduled to run weekly."
QUESTION NO: 287,"Universal Containers wants to understand return on investment for the latest advertising buy.
They currently use a private security model for all objects.
What should an app builder recommend?",A. Utilize Account Hierarchies and Roil-Up Summary fields,B. Run an opportunities pipeline report,C. Change to a public security model,,,,D,"For Universal Containers to understand the return on investment (ROI) for their latest
advertising buy while using a private security model, the best recommendation is to use
Campaign Hierarchies and Campaign statistics.
Campaign Hierarchies and Campaign Statistics: Campaign hierarchies allow Universal
Containers to track the effectiveness and ROI of marketing efforts by grouping related
campaigns (e.g., advertising buys) under a parent campaign and rolling up key metrics like
responses, converted leads, and won opportunities. Campaign statistics provide detailed
insights into individual and aggregate campaign performance, helping calculate ROI.
This method works well within a private security model since it respects existing sharing rules
and access controls, ensuring that only authorized users can see the campaign data.
Reference:
Option A (Account Hierarchies and Roll-Up Summary fields): Account hierarchies and roll-up
summary fields focus on aggregating account-level data, which doesn't directly support
measuring the ROI of advertising campaigns.
Option B (Opportunities Pipeline Report): While an opportunities pipeline report can provide
insights into sales, it doesn't track campaign-related data or advertising ROI directly.
Option C (Change to a Public Security Model): Changing to a public security model isn't
necessary and could expose sensitive data. Campaign hierarchies and statistics work well
with a private security model.
In summary, Campaign Hierarchies and Campaign Statistics are the recommended approach
to track the ROI of advertising buys.

QUESTION NO: 288,"Universal Containers (UC) requires that all users specify a contract is sent on each
Opportunity prior to marking it as ""Closed Won"". UC wants to be able to report on how many
Opportunities have sent Contracts compared to how many have a missing contract when the
Opportunities closed.
Which field type should an app builder configure to fulfill this requirement?",A. Text,B. Text Area,C. Picklise,,,,D,"For tracking whether contracts have been sent for Opportunities:
D . Checkbox. This field type allows users to clearly indicate (Yes/No) whether a contract has
been sent. This binary nature of checkboxes makes it simple to filter and report on
Opportunities based on whether a contract was sent.
Steps to configure this field:
Navigate to Setup → Object Manager → Opportunity.
Click Fields & Relationships → New → Checkbox.
Define the field with a label (e.g., Contract Sent).
Set the default value to false (unchecked).
Add the field to the relevant page layouts.
This setup facilitates accurate reporting and ensures that opportunities cannot be marked as
""Closed Won"" without indicating whether a contract was sent.
For guidance on creating fields, see Salesforce's documentation on Custom Field Creation."
QUESTION NO: 289,"Universal Containers generates leads from three different sources: web, trade shows, and
partners. Some of the information collected is applicable to all sources, there is also
information that is unique to each type of lead. What should an app builder configure to meet
these requirements?",A. Create three lead record types each with its own page layout containing the relevant fields,B. Create a partner community and a record type for web and trade show leads,C. Create three sections on the lead layout and instruct users to collapse the non-relevant fields,,,,A,"The solution that the app builder should configure to meet these requirements is creating
three lead record types each with its own page layout containing the relevant fields. This way,
the app builder can customize the fields and sections that appear on each record type based
on the source of the lead. Option B is incorrect because creating a partner community and a
record type for web and trade show leads does not address the requirement of collecting
information that is unique to each type of lead, as partner community users may have
different fields and layouts than internal users. Option C is incorrect because creating three
sections on the lead layout and instructing users to collapse the non-relevant fields does not
address the requirement of collecting information that is unique to each type of lead, as users
may still see or enter data in the wrong fields. Option D is incorrect because creating custom
page layouts for each type of lead only containing the relevant fields does not address the
requirement of collecting information that is applicable to all sources, as users may miss
some common fields."
QUESTION NO: 290,"Cloud Kicks wants to know the total value of all won Opportunities for Accounts and display it
on the record.
What type of summary should the app builder use in the roll-up summary field?",A. Count,B. Q Max,C. Sum,,,,C,"The app builder should use Sum as the type of summary in the roll-up summary field. A Sum
type of summary allows the app builder to calculate the total value of a numeric field from the
child records related to a parent record by a master-detail relationship. The app builder can
create a roll-up summary field on the Account object that sums the Amount field from the won
Opportunities related to each Account. Count is not a valid type of summary, as it does not
calculate the total value of a numeric field. A Count type of summary allows the app builder to
count the number of child records related to a parent record by a master-detail relationship.
Max is not a valid type of summary, as it does not calculate the total value of a numeric field.
A Max type of summary allows the app builder to display the largest value of a numeric or
date field from the child records related to a parent record by a master-detail relationship. Min
is not a valid type of summary, as it does not calculate the total value of a numeric field. A
Min type of summary allows the app builder to display the smallest value of a numeric or date
field from the child records related to a parent record by a master-detail relationship."
